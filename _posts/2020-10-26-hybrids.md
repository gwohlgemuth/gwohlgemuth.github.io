# Create Web Components with Hybrids

There is a relatively new library called <a href="https://hybrids.js.org/"><em>hybrids</em></a>
which, among other things, simplifies the creation of web components.
I made my first attempts with it by programming the comment function with it.
You can try out the implementation by writing a comment.
I would like to know what others think of it.

Here is the implementation of the "PostComment" web component:

```javascript
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ramda/0.25.0/ramda.min.js"></script>

<script type="module">
  import {property, define, html} from
    "https://unpkg.com/hybrids@4.3.1/src/index.js"

  const issueUrl = issue =>
    `https://github.com/gwohlgemuth/comments/issues/${issue}`

  const commentsUrl = unit =>
    'https://api.github.com/repos/gwohlgemuth/comments/issues/comments'

  const commentsPromise = R.compose(fetch, commentsUrl)

  const issueNumber = R.compose(Number, R.head, R.reverse, R.split('/'))

  const filterIssueComment = issue => comment =>
    issueNumber(comment.issue_url) === (issue)

  const commentsJson = issue => comments =>
    comments.json().then(interpretJson(issue))

  const commentContentHtml = comment =>
    commentHtml(comment.user.avatar_url)(comment.user.login)(comment.body)

  const filterComments = issue => R.compose(R.filter, filterIssueComment)(issue)

  const interpretJson = issue => comments =>
    html`<ul>${R.map(commentContentHtml)(filterComments(issue)(comments))}</ul>`

  const commentHtml = avatar_url => login => body => {
    return html`
<li>
  <div style="display: flex;">
    <img style="margin-right: 10px" src="${avatar_url}" width="20" height="20">
    <div>@${login}</div>
  </div>
  <div ><span>${body}</span></div>
</li>`
  }

  const commentSectionHtml = issue => html`
<div>
  <a href=${issueUrl ( issue )}>Post a comment on Github</a>
  <div>
    ${html.resolve(commentsPromise().then(commentsJson( issue )))}
  </div>
</div>`

  const PostComment = {
    issue : 0
  , render : ({issue}) => commentSectionHtml( issue )
  }

  define('post-comment' , PostComment)
</script>

```

The implementation is in the file “comment-new.html” and is used in this post as follows:

---

&#123;% include comment-new.html %&#125;

&#60;post-comment issue="2"&#62;&#60;/post-comment&#62;

---

Issue 2 was thus assigned to the comments

{% include comment-new.html %}
<post-comment issue="2"></post-comment>
